The backend module
------------------

The backend module provides you a convenient way to manage the messages
and (if enabled) the settings of the "cookie-banner". This banner has to
be enabled by your integrator or website administrator, ask him for
further explanations.

The backend module can be reached by clicking on the "Frontend Cookies"
module from the module list (see the red mark in the following picture):

.. _section-user-editmessageblockrecords:

Edit Message block records
--------------------------

The default view of the backend module shows you the so called "message
block" records. These will be shown within the frontend plugin, dependent
on the access settings, which you can define per record.

You can:

   * Create new records
   * Edit existing records
   * Hide/unhide records
   * Move records up/down in the list (if there is more than one)
   * Delete records

.. tip::
   
   The "message block" records can exist on any page in the page tree,
   you have to select the correct page in advance. In a normal scenario
   this will be the root page of your website. Your integrator will
   inform you, which page you have to select.

frontend plugin. It can be accessed through the link inside the
